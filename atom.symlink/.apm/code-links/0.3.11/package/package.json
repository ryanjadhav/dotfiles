The link opens the URL in the default external browser or shows the web page inside atom if the package `web-browser` is installed.\n\n# Upcoming plans\n\n* core\n  * [x] Hide the underlines by default, only show them while holding the modifier key.\n  * [x] Add the ability to jump to a specific line in a file once it's open.\n* JavaScript Processor\n  * [x] Parse the AST and read all `require()`s and `imports`.\n  * [x] Jump using module names that aren't relative paths.\n  * [x] Make variables into links so you can jump to where they're defined.\n\n```javascript\nconst SubAtom = require('sub-atom')\n// ... many lines later ...\n    this.subs = new SubAtom()\n    //              ^\n    // Jump the same as if you clicked the require.\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AsaAyers/code-links/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AsaAyers/code-links","_id":"code-links@0.3.11","_shasum":"2a35cfa78c0dbe7dc1f308dbd80f0793ce62b26d","_resolved":"file:../d-115421-56437-t6noko/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115421-56437-t6noko/package.tgz"}
